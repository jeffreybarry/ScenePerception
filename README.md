# 🎞️ ScenePerception

**🧠 Evaluating how AI models render scenes—in images, video, and 3D space.**

ScenePerception is a benchmark suite for assessing the ability of AI models to transform natural language prompts into coherent visual scenes. It spans multiple modalities—🖼️ image, 🎥 video, and 🌐 3D environments—and focuses on the cognitive, semantic, and spatial challenges of generative scene construction.

Whether you're working with image generators, video synthesis tools, or 3D scene generation for virtual and mixed reality, ScenePerception helps evaluate how well your model captures not just what a prompt says, but what it *means*.

## ❓ Why ScenePerception?

As generative models advance, there's a growing need to evaluate not only output quality but also other factors:

- 🧩 **Scene comprehension**
- 🗺️ **Prompt grounding**
- 🔍 **Visual logic and reasoning**

ScenePerception provides structured challenges for assessment:

- 📝 Semantic fidelity  
- 🏗️ Compositional and spatial reasoning  
- ⏱️ Temporal coherence in video  
- 🧍‍♂️ Embodied scene logic in 3D environments  
- 🧙‍♀️ Integration of magical/absurd elements into realistic worlds (aka "whimsical realism")

## 🧪 Benchmark Structure

ScenePerception is organized into modular categories across three tiers:

### 🧩 Tier 1: Foundational Perception in Static Images

- 🧾 **Text Rendering & Integration** – legibility and contextual placement of signs, labels, written documents.  
- 🧱 **Compositional Coherence** – spatial logic, layering, and object relationships.  
- 🧠 **Semantic Grounding** – fidelity to the concepts, entities, and abstract ideas in the prompt.  
- 🎭 **Character Consistency & Expression** – age, emotion, pose, and inter-character logic.  
- 🎨 **Realism vs. Stylization Control** – responsiveness to visual style instructions.

---

### 🎬 Tier 2: Temporal & Narrative Coherence in Video

- 🎞️ **Temporal Continuity** – consistency in objects, lighting, and movement across frames.  
- 📖 **Narrative Logic & Emotional Flow** – unfolding of events and emotional shifts over time.

---

### 🧭 Tier 3: Embodied & Spatial Perception in 3D

- 🧩 **3D Spatial Composition** – logical and navigable layouts of environments.  
- 📷 **Viewpoint Awareness & Perspective Control** – correct handling of first-/third-person views and camera dynamics.  
- 🚪 **Embodied Scene Logic** – spatial realism that supports implied human interaction.

---

### ✨ Cross-Cutting Category: Whimsical Realism

Across all tiers, this evaluates whether models can blend fantastical or absurd elements into otherwise realistic scenes, without breaking visual or semantic logic.

## 🔭 Roadmap

ScenePerception will evolve as the field advances. Planned additions:

- 🧪 Expanded test sets and automated scoring tools  
- 📊 Metrics for consistency, grounding, and stylistic fidelity  
- 📚 Best practices and generation guidelines  
- 🕶️ Evaluation extensions for AR/VR applications
